    title: HCI
    summary: |
                I believe the "Human-Computer Communication" course will be useful for the implementation of my personal project. As I consider that the course teaches us how to act within the graphic environment of the computer, I will understand the actions we can take to achieve the desired result. Specifically, I want to create a video game to achieve this mutual interaction with the user.
