    summary: |
      With the course "Human-Computer Communication", I will develop an innovative digital application-service, based on humans and their needs. This Summer I did my internship at a startup company, where we created an innovative project "Tilderist" that automates the legal documents of small enterprises. So my collaboration with the team was inspirational for my personal project.
